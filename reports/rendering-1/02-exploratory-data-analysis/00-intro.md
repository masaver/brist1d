# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we will analyse the raw data and try to understand the structure and consistency of the data.

## Dataset description and structure

* Dataset description and structure
* Dataset consistency checks
  * Compare training and test data
  * Count data points for each patient
  * Time resolution and consistency
  * Lag-features consistency
* Data validation and cleaning
  * Outliers and anomalies
  * Missing values and imputation strategies
  * Further dataset discrepancies
* Data visualization
  * Time series data visualization
  * Lag-features visualization
  * Target variable visualization
* Data correlation
  * Correlation between lag-features and target variable
  * Correlation between lag-features
* Data distribution
  * Distribution of the target variable
  * Distribution of the lag-features
* Preprocessing
  * Create time series data for each patient
  * Set the same time resolution of the time series data for each patient
  * Check and combine the lag-features for each patient into one column for each variable
