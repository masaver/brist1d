# Exploratory Data Analysis


In this section, we will examine the raw dataset to gain insights into its structure, consistency, and key characteristics. This analysis aims to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and evaluate data quality, which are critical steps in preparing the dataset for further modeling and analysis.

## Dataset description and structure

* Dataset description and structure
* Dataset consistency checks
  * Compare training and test data
  * Count data points for each patient
  * Time resolution and consistency
  * Lag-features consistency
* Data validation and cleaning
  * Outliers and anomalies
  * Missing values and imputation strategies
  * Further dataset discrepancies
* Data visualization
  * Time series data visualization
  * Lag-features visualization
  * Target variable visualization
* Data correlation
  * Correlation between lag-features and target variable
* Data distribution
  * Distribution of the target variable
  * Distribution of the lag-features

<!--
* Preprocessing
  * Create time series data for each patient
  * Set the same time resolution of the time series data for each patient
  * Check and combine the lag-features for each patient into one column for each variable
