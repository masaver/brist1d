    abstract = "Accurate prediction of blood glucose level (BGL) has proven to be an effective way to help in type 1 diabetes management. The choice of input, along with the fundamental choice of model structure, is an existing challenge in BGL prediction. Investigating the performance of different data-driven time series forecasting approaches with different inputs for BGL prediction is beneficial in advancing BGL prediction performance. Limited work has been made in this regard, which has resulted in different conclusions. This paper performs a comprehensive investigation of different data-driven time series forecasting approaches using different inputs. To do so, BGL prediction is comparatively investigated from two perspectives; the model's approach and the model's input. First, we compare the performance of BGL prediction using different data-driven time series forecasting approaches, including classical time series forecasting, traditional machine learning, and deep neural networks. Secondly, for each prediction approach, univariate input, using BGL data only, is compared to a multivariate input, using data on carbohydrate intake, injected bolus insulin, and physical activity in addition to BGL data. The investigation is performed on two publicly available Ohio datasets. Regression-based and clinical-based metrics along with statistical analyses are performed for evaluation and comparison purposes. The outcomes show that the traditional machine learning model is the fastest model to train and has the best BGL prediction performance especially when using multivariate input. Also, results show that simply adding extra variables does not necessarily improve BGL prediction performance significantly, and data fusion approaches may be required to effectively leverage other variables' information.",

    abstract = "This paper documents the OhioT1DM Dataset, which was developed to
              promote and facilitate research in blood glucose level
              prediction. It contains eight weeks' worth of continuous glucose
              monitoring, insulin, physiological sensor, and self-reported
              life-event data for each of 12 people with type 1 diabetes. An
              associated graphical software tool allows researchers to
              visualize the integrated data. The paper details the contents and
              format of the dataset and tells interested researchers how to
              obtain it. The OhioT1DM Dataset was first released in 2018 for
              the first Blood Glucose Level Prediction (BGLP) Challenge. At
              that time, the dataset was half its current size, containing data
              for only six people with type 1 diabetes. Data for an additional
              six people is being released in 2020 for the second BGLP
              Challenge. This paper subsumes and supersedes the paper which
              documented the original dataset.",
