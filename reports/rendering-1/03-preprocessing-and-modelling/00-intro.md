# Modelling
The objective of this section perform in-depth analysis and/or modelling using relevant Machine (and Deep) Learning models.

* Relevant preprocessing steps
  
* Preliminary Modelling usinig LazyPredict
  * Running LazyPredict with the raw data ( lag features on a wide format )
  * Running LazyPredict with the re-formatted data ( entire time series ; long )
