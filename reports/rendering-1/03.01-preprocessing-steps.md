# Preprocessing steps
In this section we outline the pre-processing steps that we think will be requiered in order to correctly format the data before different forms of modelling

Based on our exploratory data analysis, the following preprocessing steps are the most appropiate
* Columns related to **calories** and **activity are initially removed, as they have very large fractions of NAs (>95%)
  * Remove two rows where procblematic values exist for patient **p11**
  * For **p12** two values in the insulin columns are negative. We can fix them by replacing them with the median of this feature
  NOTE: the value inconsistencies for **p11** and **p12** are very small compared with the size of the dataset. Therefore, they could largely be ignored for modelling
  * The remainder columns are al numeric and should be standarized ( e.g: with StandardScaler() )
