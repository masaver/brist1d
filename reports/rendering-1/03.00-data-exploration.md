# Data Exploration

In this section, we will explore the raw data and try to understand the data better. We will perform the following steps:

## Data consistency

1. Compare the training and test data to see if there are any differences between the two datasets columns.
2. Count the number of data points for each patient in training and test data.
3. Check the time resolution and their consistency for each patient.
4. Check if the lag-features are consistent across the data points.

## Data correlation

1. Check the correlation between the lag-features and the target variable.
2. Check the correlation between the lag-features.

## Data distribution

1. Check the distribution of the target variable.
2. Check the distribution of the lag-features.

## Preprocessing

1. Create time series data for each patient.
2. Set the same time resolution of the time series data for each patient.
3. Check and combine the lag-features for each patient into one column for each variable.
