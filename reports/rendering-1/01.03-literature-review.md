## Blood Glucose Prediction

An important part of type 1 diabetes management is working out how blood glucose levels are going to change in the future. Algorithms of varying levels of complexity have been developed that perform this prediction but the messy nature of health data and the numerous unmeasured factors mean there is a limit to how effective they can be. This competition aims to build on this work by challenging people to predict future blood glucose on a newly collected dataset.

## Literature Review on Blood Glucose Prediction

A meta study by [1] provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research on blood glucose prediction. The study covers various aspects of blood glucose prediction, including:

- Data sources
- Feature selection
- Machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation metrics
- Challenges and limitations
- Future research directions
- The study concludes that blood glucose prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of the underlying physiological processes and the high variability of blood glucose levels.
