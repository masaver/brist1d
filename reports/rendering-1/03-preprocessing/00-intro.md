# Preprocessing

The objective of this section is to show and explain the different preprocessing steps and feature engineering that we have done in the context of the Kaggle competition.

The preprocessing steps are crucial to ensure that the data is in a format that can be used for modelling.

## Preprocessing steps

In this section we outline the pre-processing steps that we think will be required in order to correctly format the data before different forms of modelling.

We wrote a bunch of [transformers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html) highly adapted to our data. We will use them to preprocess the data before modelling and
before predicting.
