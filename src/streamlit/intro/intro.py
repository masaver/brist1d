                    Predicting blood glucose fluctuations is crucial for managing type 1 diabetes. An accurate forecast can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by individuals with the condition.

## Description

### Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease in which the body is no longer able to produce the hormone insulin. Insulin is required by the body to regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream. Without treatment T1D results in high blood glucose levels which can cause symptoms like frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, weight loss, blurry vision, tiredness, and slow wound healing. Ultimately high blood glucose levels will be fatal. In order to survive those suffering from T1D need to inject insulin to manage their blood glucose levels. Since also low blood glucose levels are potentially life-threatening and insulin counteracts the level of blood glucose it is important to establish a careful insulin management. There are many other factors that impact blood glucose levels, including eating, physical activity, stress, illness, sleep and alcohol. Hence calculating how much insulin to apply is complex. But the continuous need to think about how an action may impact blood glucose levels and what to do to counteract them is a significant burden for those with T1D.

### The Goal

Therefore developing algorithms which can reliably predict blood glucose levels in the future can play an important role in T1D management. Algorithms of varying levels of complexity have been developed that perform this prediction but the noisy nature of health data and the numerous unmeasured factors that impact the target mean there is a limit to how effective they can be. This project aims to use a newly collected dataset in order to predict blood glucose levels one hour ahead of time of patients with T1D.

                  
### The Dataset

The data used in this project was part of a kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brist1d) in which our team also participated. It is part of a bigger newly collected dataset of real-world data collected from young adults in the UK who suffer from T1D. All participants used continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps and were given a smartwatch as part of the study to collect activity data. It is structured as follows:

The RMSE is defined as: 

$$ \\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} $$

where $n$ is the number of samples, $\hat{y}_i$ is the $i$-th predicted value and $y_i$ is the $i$-th actual value.""")
