# Introduction

Predicting blood glucose fluctuations is crucial for managing type 1 diabetes. Developing effective algorithms for this can alleviate some of the challenges faced by individuals with the condition.

## Goal

Forecast blood glucose levels one hour ahead using the previous six hours of participant data.

## Description

### Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body no longer produces the hormone insulin and therefore cannot regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream. Without careful management, this can be life-threatening and so those with the condition need to inject insulin to manage their blood glucose levels themselves. There are many different factors that impact blood glucose levels, including eating, physical activity, stress, illness, sleep, alcohol, and many more, so calculating how much insulin to give is complex. The continuous need to think about how an action may impact blood glucose levels and what to do to counteract it is a significant burden for those with type 1 diabetes.

An important part of type 1 diabetes management is working out how blood glucose levels are going to change in the future. Algorithms of varying levels of complexity have been developed that perform this prediction but the messy nature of health data and the numerous unmeasured factors mean there is a limit to how effective they can be. This competition aims to build on this work by challenging people to predict future blood glucose on a newly collected dataset.

### The Dataset

The data used in this competition is part of a newly collected dataset of real-world data collected from young adults in the UK who have type 1 diabetes. All participants used continuous glucose monitors, and insulin pumps and were given a smartwatch as part of the study to collect activity data. The complete dataset will be published after the competition for research purposes. Some more details about the study can be found in this blog post.

### Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the predicted blood glucose levels an hour into the future and the actual values that were then collected.

RMSE is defined as: 

$$ \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} $$

where ùë¶ÃÇ ùëñ is the ùëñ-th predicted value, ùë¶ùëñ is the ùëñ-th true value and ùëõ is the number of samples.

The RMSE value is calculated from the bg+1:00(future blood glucose) prediction values in the submission file against the true future blood glucose values. The RMSE values for the public and private leaderboards are calculated from unknown and non-overlapping samples from the submission file across all of the participants.
